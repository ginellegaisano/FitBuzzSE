# FitBuzzSE
A web application that, when paired with a FitBit, enables users to configure a polyphasic sleep schedule. After customization, FitBuzz pushes alarms to the user's FitBit, buzzing when the user should go to sleep or awaken, respectively.

As well, FitBuzz collects metrics tracked by FitBit and displays them.
